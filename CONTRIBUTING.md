Contributions to the Quasar DSP library are welcome and encouraged. However,
there are some things to observe if you want your code to be integrated into 
the main branch.
 
  1) Code must be licensed under a free and permissive license such as the MIT, 
     BSD, or Apache 2.0 license. Copyleft licenses as well as licenses that prohibit
     the commercial use of this library will not be accepted.
  2) For modifications to existing files you must either transfer the copyright of the
     changes you made to the respective maintainers of Quasar or clearly document the 
     changes you made in the file and the respective license those changes fall under.
  3) For completely new files, simply writing Copyright <your name> <year> and license
     is sufficient.
  4) All code must be documented clearly and written in a maintainable way. Document 
     anything you do that is not obvious or otherwise difficult to understand.
     Assume the person reading the code after you is a crazy unstable stalker that
     will hunt you down if they find faults in your code/documentation.
  
Issues

	No software is perfect and Quasar is no exception. Thus, when you eventually do
	encounter a bug in Quasar please report the issue on Github and provide as much
	detail as possible. Simply saying something is broken or does not work is not
	helpful and provides little insight in to the nature of the bug. Providing a 
	stack trace, workflow, and other information that can lead to issue reproduction
	is strongly encouraged. 
	
	If you have experience with software development and can provide a fix to the issue
	please post your issue with a push request containing source solving the issue. This
	way is the most likely way to have your issue resolved.
