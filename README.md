Note - This library is no longer maintained  as it was originally developed with the intention of creating a SDR radar. See https://github.com/r0wbrt/YASDRR for the realization of this goal.

About
=======

Quasar is a fork of the free and open source Aquila library. The main difference between 
Quasar and Aquila is templating. Quasar is designed to be a templated mostly headers only
library. The goal of Quasar is to allow any numeric type to be dropped in. Many algorithms
have been tested with both real (double) and comple (std::complex<double>) types. For
most core classes, it is as simple as specifying the type you wish to use as a template 
argument.

However, support for fixed based computation is still lacking and most 
algorithms assume floating point based numbers. Expanding support 
of the library to cover fixed point types is still under research.
